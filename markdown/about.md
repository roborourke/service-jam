Jammers have 48 hours to work together in teams problem-solving through service design (ie to make something that is socially useful and human-centred). Despite working to a tight deadline, jams are playful, a fun and safe space to try out and learn new things.

-------------

Everyone gathers on Friday evening to discover a global theme, which is kept secret until jams all over the world have seen it.

We split into teams and work together through Saturday and Sunday to design and prototype new services inspired by the theme.

At 3pm on Sunday everyone shows what they've made and shares their work online with a [Creative Commons License][cc].

-------------

We provide the venue, materials and service design inspiration. All we need is YOU, and some magical collaboration. What will you design in 48 hours?

Up to 30 jammers will take part. We hope you'll be one of them!

The Liverpool Service Jam is not-for-profit and run by volunteers. Your ticket price covers event costs and includes materials, drinks and a sandwich lunch.

### FAQs

#### Is there an age limit to enter the event?

Yes. You must be 18 or older to take part in Liverpool Service Jam.

#### What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?

Tempest is a short walk from Liverpool rail stations, the closest one is Moorfields which connects to Lime St. The nearest public car park is off Tempest Hey St.

#### What hours will the jam be on during the weekend?

The core hours of the jam will be:
Friday 9 March 2018 from 6pm to 9pm
Saturday 10 March 2018 from 9:30am to 5pm
Sunday 11 March 2018 from 9:30am to 4pm

#### What can I bring to the event?

Pretty much anything! But, all you need to bring is yourself, your ideas and enthusiasm. If you like you could add prototyping materials, cardboard, Lego, play dough, whatever you like. If you like prototyping digitally bring a laptop, camera, or other kit. The space may be busy at times, so make sure you clearly mark anything you want to take home at the end of the event. We can't be held responsible for your personal possessions while in the jam, so anything you do bring along is at your own risk.

#### What about food and drink?

We'll provide sandwiches and snacks and tea/coffee-making facilities in the jam space. Jammers can bring or buy their own lunch and Liverpool city centre with a wide selection of food options is just a short walk away from the venue.

#### What if I can't make the whole weekend?

You really need to be there on Friday evening for the kick-off and secret theme video, but after that some participants do just one of the other days - Saturday or Sunday. Please let us know if you intend to do this so we can plan timings and manage the number of participants in the space.

#### What happens to the things we make during the jam?

At the end of the jam, we'll upload copies of the things we've made to the global jamsite. Everything created during the jam will be released under a [Creative Commons License][cc].

#### Are there any other terms and conditions?
Liverpool Service Jam is part of the [Global Service Jam 2018][global]. We ask all participants to confirm that they understand the jam terms and conditions.
