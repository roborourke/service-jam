    job: User Experience Lead at Uniform
    bio: |
      I'm UX lead at Uniform, mostly focusing on UX strategy, currently working with Unilever on a digital transformation project. I've been mixing UX strategy with service design and have seen some great results from it.

      I have attended jams in the past and worked with Kathryn Grace in Manchester to help facilitate Manchester Jam days with Co-Op Digital. I can help bring tools to the jam and facilitation skills. I love helping people with processes and helping to spot opportunities from insights.

      I'm a learning designer and owner of OH, an alternative education company based in Liverpool. I'm a big believer in collaboration and community, and I put them both at the heart of all my work.

      I'm getting involved in Liverpool Service Design Jam because I love the concept of working in diverse teams to drum up new ways of addressing global problems.
