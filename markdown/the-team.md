    job: User Experience Designer
    bio: |
      I’ve been working in UX for the last ten years but for the last five I’ve been developing Service Design skills. The best thing I ever did was attend the Leeds Service Jams, they opened my eyes to how my skills can be used to solve social problems. It also opened me up to a highly creative, fun and supportive network. I’m looking forward to growing the service design community in Liverpool and I’m very excited to be co-hosting the event with such a brilliant team.

    job: Designer at Creative Concern
    bio: |
      I'm a graphic designer at Creative Concern, an ethically driven communications agency based in Manchester.

      I'm really interested in the ways that service design utilises design thinking and the power of collaboration as tools for innovation and social change. Previously I have been involved with a range of service design projects with Macmillan, Swarm and Imperial College Hospital Trust that all focused on improving patient care.

      I'm a learning designer and owner of OH, an alternative education company based in Liverpool. I'm a big believer in collaboration and community, and I put them both at the heart of all my work.

      I'm getting involved in Liverpool Service Design Jam because I love the concept of working in diverse teams to drum up new ways of addressing global problems.
