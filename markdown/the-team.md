    job: Service Designer
    bio: |
      Joe is a service designer at Future Gov, helping public sector organisations through digital transformation and service design.

      “I’ve been working in UX for the last ten years but for the last five I’ve been developing Service Design skills. The best thing I ever did was attend the Leeds Service Jams, they opened my eyes to how my skills can be used to solve social problems. It also opened me up to a highly creative, fun and supportive network. I’m looking forward to growing the service design community in Liverpool and I’m very excited to be co-hosting the event with such a brilliant team.”
